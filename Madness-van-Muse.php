<h1>Madness van Muse</h1>

    I, I can't get these memories out of my mind<br>
And some kind of madness has started to evolve<br>
I, I tried so hard to let you go<br>
But some kind of madness is swallowing me whole, yeah<br>
I have finally seen the light<br>
And I have finally realized<br>     
What you mean<br>
Oh oh oh<br>
<br>
And now, I need to know is this real love<br>
Or is it just madness keeping us afloat?<br>
And when I look back at all the crazy fights we had<br>
Like some kind of madness<br>
Was taking control<br>
Yeah<br>
<br>    
And now I have finally seen the light<br>
And I have finally realized<br>
What you need<br>
Mm<br>
<br>
And now I have finally seen the end (Finally seen the end)<br>
And I'm not expecting you to care (Expecting you to care)<br>
But I have finally seen the light (Finally seen the light)<br>
I have finally realized (Realized)<br>
I need to love<br>
I need to love<br>
<br>

Come to me,<br>
Trust in your dream<br>
Come on and rescue me<br>
Yes I have known, I can be wrong<br>
Maybe I'm too headstrong<br>
Our love is<br>
Madness

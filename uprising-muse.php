  Paranoia is in bloom,
  The PR transmissions will resume
  They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
  And hope that we will never see the truth around
  (so come on)

  Another promise, another seed
  Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
  And all the green belts wrapped around our minds
  And endless red tape to keep the truth confined
  (so come on)

  They will not force us
  They will stop degrading us
  They will not control us
  We will be victorious
  (so come on)

  Interchanging mind control
  Come, let the revolution take its toll
  If you could flick the switch and open your third eye
  You'd see that we should never be afraid to die
  (so come on)

  Rise up and take the power back
  It's time the fat cats had a heart attack
  You know that their time's coming to an end
  We have to unify and watch our flag ascend
  (so come on)

  They will not force us
  They will stop degrading us
  They will not control us
  We will be victorious
  (so come on)

  Hey, hey, hey, hey
  Hey, hey, hey, hey
  Hey, hey, hey, hey

  They will not force us
  They will stop degrading us
  They will not control us
  We will be victorious
  (so come on)

  Hey, hey, hey, hey

<p class ="lyrics">
  Allow me in your tub
  Allow me in your club
  Allow me to drink from your cup
  I'll be coming back for more

  Allow me in your dream
  Allow me in your scene
  Allow me on your knees
  I'll be coming back for more

  Sisters, keep on rising
  Brothers, keep on rising
  This girl keeps on rising
  Keep on rising up

  I Believe in your school
  I Believe in your rules
  I Believe in your truth
  I'll be coming back for more

  I Believe in your land
  I Believe in that man
  I Believe in your command
  I'll be coming back for more

  Sisters, Brothers, Lovers
  Keep on rising up

  Sisters, keep on rising
  Brothers, keep on rising
  This girl keeps on rising
  Keep on rising up

  Uprising, uprising

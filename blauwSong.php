                        Is this the real life?
                        Is this just fantasy?
                        Caught in a landside,
                        No escape from reality
                        Open your eyes,
                        Look up to the skies and see,
                        I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
                        Because I'm easy come, easy go,
                        Little high, little low,
                        Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to
                        Me, to me
                        Mamaaa,
                        Just killed a man,
                        Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger,
                        Now he's dead
                        Mamaaa, life had just begun,
                        But now I've gone and thrown it all away
                        Mama, oooh,
                        Didn't mean to make you cry,
                        If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
                        Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
                        Too late, my time has come,
                        Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all
                        The time
                        Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
                        Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
                        Mama, oooh
                        I don't want to die,
                        I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.
                        I see a little silhouetto of a man,
                        Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you do the Fandango!
                        Thunderbolts and lightning, very, very frightening me

                        Galileo, Figaro - magnificoo
                        I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me
                        He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
                        Spare him his life from this monstrosity
                        Easy come, easy go, will you let me go
                        Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
                        (Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
                        (Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
                        (Let me go) Will not let you go
                        (Let me go)(Never) Never let you go
                        (Let me go) (Never) let you go (Let me go) Ah
                        No, no, no, no, no, no, no
                        Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go
                        Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me,
                        For meee
                        So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
                        So you think you can love me and leave me to die
                        Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
                        Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
                        Nothing really matters, Anyone can see,
                        Nothing really matters,
                        Nothing really matters to me
                        Any way the wind blows...

                        I've paid my dues
                        Time after time
                        I've done my sentence
                        But committed no crime
                        And bad mistakes
                        I've made a few
                        I've had my share of sand
                        Kicked in my face

                        You brought me fame and fortune
                        And everything that goes with it
                        I thank you all
                        But it's been no bed of roses
                        No pleasure cruise
                        I consider it a challenge before
                        The human race
                        And I ain't gonna lose
